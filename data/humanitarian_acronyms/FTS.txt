FTS –  a reporting and tracking platform run by UN OCHA, the humanitarian coordinative UN body, to consolidate data on humanitarian funding flows and publish it in close to real-time. It's probably the main data use we use to analyse humanitarian funding, next to the OECD DAC CRS, because the data is a lot more timely than the CRS - and timely data is what humanitarians need most of the time, because they're interested in the now or the immediate past of crises. The FTS payoff is though that the data has more gaps and oddities, because there's less time to consolidate/verify it. A specifically humanitarian database. Almost as good as CRS. A curation (/verification) process occurs every year in April – but you can access the data before that. The longer you wait, the more information is attached to a record.
