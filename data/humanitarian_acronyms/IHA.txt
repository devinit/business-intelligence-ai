IHA – International Humanitarian Assistance - Financial resources that support international humanitarian action. ALNAP defines humanitarian action as “the principled provision of assistance and protection in order to save lives, prevent and reduce suffering and preserve people’s dignity in crises arising from armed conflict, hazards and other causes. Humanitarian action is international when these activities involve resources (financial, technical or in-kind) provided by sources in one country to respond to a crisis in another. International humanitarian action excludes responses that are fully resourced within the country experiencing the crisis, which fall within the domain of domestic crisis management.”
