WAHAFA -  Welthungerhilfe Anticipatory Humanitarian Action Facility Through the Welthungerhilfe Anticipatory Humanitarian Action Facility (WAHAFA), WHH wants to join forces with other non-governmental organizations to advance this humanitarian paradigm shift towards increased anticipatory thinking and acting. The WAHAFA programme aims to identify and analyze disaster risks, support the development of Anticipatory Action mechanisms, and secure funding to implement these mechanisms.  The WAHAFA will facilitate the active participation of German NGOs and their local humanitarian partners in Anticipatory Action by facilitating access to all needed key pillars. Participating organizations will be invited to join the capacity-sharing advances and receive budgetary and conceptual support in building scientific hazard forecasting models behind the trigger mechanisms and community-based and risk-informed Early Action Protocols, which outline appropriate measures to take in case of an impending hazard. These are further linked to guaranteed funding of pre-agreed early actions in case of triggering the scientific forecasting system.
