CBPF – Country based pooled funds Country-based Pooled Funds (CBPF) allow donors to pool their contributions into single, unearmarked funds to support local humanitarian efforts. This enables humanitarian partners in crisis-affected countries to deliver timely, coordinated and principled assistance. CBPF are established when a new emergency occurs or when an existing crisis deteriorates. They are managed by OCHA under the leadership of the Humanitarian Coordinator and in close consultation with the humanitarian community. The funds support the highest-priority projects of the best-placed responders (including international and national NGOs and UN agencies) through an inclusive and transparent process that supports priorities set out in Humanitarian Response Plans (HRPs). This ensures that funding is available and prioritized locally by those closest to people in need: https://www.unocha.org/our-work/humanitarian-financing/country-based-pooled-funds-cbpf
