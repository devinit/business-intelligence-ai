Climate Justice - "Climate justice" is the ethical principle that seeks to ensure a fair and equitable response to the global climate crisis, recognising that the impacts of climate change disproportionately affect marginalised communities, who are often least responsible for the problem. Climate justice advocates for inclusive policies that mitigate risks, promote access, and enhance resilience in the face of environmental challenges. It strives to rectify historical and systemic injustices, fostering a more balanced and harmonious relationship between people, the planet, and future generations.
