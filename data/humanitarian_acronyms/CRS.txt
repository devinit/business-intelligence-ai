CRS – Creditor Reporting System; database where creditors report on their contributions of ODA and other funding (other official flows – OOF) relating to aid. Core creditors are OECD DAC countries, multilateral organisations, private organisations e.g. BMGF and non-DAC members/other countries e.g. Gulf countries, eastern European countries, Turkey – who voluntarily report. The benchmark for quality aid reporting; where we get all of our data for including for humanitarian assistance. We refer to data we get from CRS as ‘Official Humanitarian Assistance’ as it is generally high quality data; other side of this is there is a long (1+ year) data lag e.g. 2021 data has only just been released.
