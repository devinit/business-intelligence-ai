Climate Finance - Funding from developed counties (referred to as ‘Annex 1’ countries until the UNFCCC) to developing country parties (referred to as ‘Annex 2’ countries) that includes a range of activities to prevent, reduce and respond to the impact of the climate crisis:  
Mitigation, where a project contributes to stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere by promoting efforts to reduce or limit greenhouse gas emissions or enhance greenhouse gas sequestration.   
Adaptation, where a project seeks to reduce the vulnerability of human or natural systems to current and/or expected impacts of the climate crisis.   
Loss & Damage, where a project seeks to address the adverse impacts and harm caused by the climate crisis which cannot be mitigated or adapted to.
