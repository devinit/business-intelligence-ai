High Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing -  Panel of nine experts convened by the UN Secretary General to put for- wards recommendations for how to best address the humanitarian financing gap. One output of the report was momentum towards a Grand Bargain, which became an agreement made in 2016 between major donors and aid organisations. The agreement had three sections of recommendations aimed at shrinking the need, improving delivery, and deepening and broadening financing for humanitarian need.
