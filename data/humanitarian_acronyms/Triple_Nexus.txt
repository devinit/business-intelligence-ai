Triple Nexus - The "triple nexus" is a concept used in humanitarian and development contexts to emphasize the interconnected nature of humanitarian assistance, development, and peace efforts in addressing complex crises and promoting sustainable solutions. It recognizes the need to integrate these three pillars—humanitarian response, development programming, and peacebuilding—rather than treating them as separate and sequential activities.
